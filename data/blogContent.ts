    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I have personally driven from Delhi to Jaipur several times over the years. On paper, it looks like a simple 280 km highway drive, but timing, traffic, and planning make a huge difference. If you start wrong, the same route can feel exhausting instead of enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Time to Do This Road Trip</h2>
    <p>
      October to March is the most comfortable period. Summers in Rajasthan are brutal, and afternoon driving can drain you quickly. I strongly recommend starting early in the morning, ideally before 6 AM.
    </p>

    <h2>Route Experience (NH48)</h2>
    <p>
      NH48 is well maintained, but speed cameras are active. Manesar and Behror usually have traffic slowdowns. Neemrana is my preferred breakfast stop because of clean washrooms and safe parking.
    </p>

    <h2>Mistakes First-Time Drivers Make</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Overspeeding and getting challans.</li>
      <li>Skipping FASTag balance check.</li>
      <li>Starting late and hitting Gurgaon traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Advice</h2>
    <p>
      This drive is best enjoyed calmly. Don’t rush. Jaipur is not going anywhere.

    <h2>Why I Never Skip Safety Checks</h2>
    <p>
      On highways, small issues turn big very fast. I have seen cars stuck due to overheating, tyre bursts, and dead batteries — all avoidable with basic checks.
    </p>

    <h2>My Non-Negotiable Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Correct pressure, tread depth, and spare tyre.</li>
      <li><strong>Fluids:</strong> Engine oil, coolant, brake fluid, washer fluid.</li>
      <li><strong>Lights:</strong> Headlights, brake lights, indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>Documents:</strong> RC, Insurance, PUC, Driving License.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things People Often Forget</h2>
    <p>
      A basic first-aid kit, torch, and tyre inflator have helped me more than once — especially on night drives or remote highways.
    </p>

  content: `
    <h2>Why Rental Problems Happen</h2>
    <p>
      Most rental issues don’t start on the road — they start at pickup. Rushing through inspection and paperwork is the biggest mistake.
    </p>

    <h2>Checks I Always Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Record a full video of the car before driving.</li>
      <li>Note fuel level clearly.</li>
      <li>Confirm insurance coverage and maximum liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agreement Red Flags</h2>
    <p>
      If staff avoids explaining penalties or insurance clauses, slow down and read carefully. It saves money later.

    <h2>Why Scams Target First-Time Renters</h2>
    <p>
      Most scams rely on fear and confusion. New renters often hesitate to question damage claims or unclear charges.
    </p>

    <h2>Most Common Rental Scams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Old scratches shown as new damage.</li>
      <li>Fuel level disputes at return.</li>
      <li>Hidden insurance exclusions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I Protect Myself</h2>
    <p>
      I always record a video at pickup and drop. This single habit has saved me from false claims multiple times.

    <h2>Understanding Highway Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Indian highways change quickly — fast traffic, sudden diversions, and unpredictable vehicles are common.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules I Personally Follow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain lane discipline at all times.</li>
      <li>Avoid aggressive overtakes.</li>
      <li>Take a break every 2–3 hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Night Driving Advice</h2>
    <p>
      High beams, stray animals, and fatigue increase risk. If tired, stop. No destination is worth an accident.

  content: `
    <h2>Why This Drive Is Popular</h2>
    <p>
      Mumbai to Lonavala is one of the easiest and most rewarding short road trips. The expressway is smooth, but timing makes all the difference.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Time to Start</h2>
    <p>
      Leave Mumbai before 7 AM. After that, traffic builds up fast, especially on weekends. Evening returns are always slower.
    </p>

    <h2>Expressway Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Speed cameras are active, and lane discipline is important. During monsoon, fog and low visibility are common near Khandala.
