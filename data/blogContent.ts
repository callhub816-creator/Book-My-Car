  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  I have personally driven from Delhi to Jaipur several times over the years. On paper, it looks like a simple 280 km highway drive, but timing, traffic, and planning make a huge difference. If you start wrong, the same route can feel exhausting instead of enjoyable.
  </p>

  <h2>Best Time to Do This Road Trip</h2>
  <p>
  October to March is the most comfortable period. Summers in Rajasthan are brutal, and afternoon driving can drain you quickly. I strongly recommend starting early in the morning, ideally before 6 AM.
  </p>

  <h2>Route Experience (NH48)</h2>
  <p>
  NH48 is well maintained, but speed cameras are active. Manesar and Behror usually have traffic slowdowns. Neemrana is my preferred breakfast stop because of clean washrooms and safe parking.
  </p>

  <h2>Mistakes First-Time Drivers Make</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Overspeeding and getting challans.</li>
    <li>Skipping FASTag balance check.</li>
    <li>Starting late and hitting Gurgaon traffic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Advice</h2>
  <p>
  This drive is best enjoyed calmly. Don’t rush. Jaipur is not going anywhere.
